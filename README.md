# Project Guidelines

Welcome to the project! Please follow the instructions below to ensure smooth collaboration and code quality.

## Branching Strategy

1. **Branch Creation**:
   - Each student will have a dedicated branch named `main-<name>`.
   - Example: If your name is Abdullah, your branch should be `main-abdullah`.

2. **Working on Your Branch**:
   - Create a secondary branch for your changes from your personal branch.
   - Example: If your main branch is `main-abdullah`, create a secondary branch like `feature-abdullah`.

## Commit and Push Code

1. **Committing Changes**:
   - Commit your changes with clear and descriptive messages.
   - Example: `Added feature X to improve functionality`

2. **Pushing Changes**:
   - Push your commits to your secondary branch.
   - Use the command: `git push origin <secondary-branch>`

## Pull Requests

1. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Once you are ready to merge your changes, create a pull request (PR) from your secondary branch to your main branch (`main-<name>`).
   - Example: Create a PR from `feature-abdullah` to `main-abdullah`.
   - Provide a clear description of the changes made in the pull request.

2. **Code Review**:
   - Your code will be reviewed by the project maintainers.
   - Make any necessary revisions based on feedback provided during the review.

3. **Merging**:
   - Your pull request will be merged into your main branch (`main-<name>`) once it has been reviewed and approved.

## Summary

- **Branch Naming**: Use `main-<name>` for your main branch and create secondary branches for your changes.
- **Work**: Make changes in your secondary branch.
- **Push**: Push changes to your secondary branch.
- **Pull Request**: Create a PR from your secondary branch to `main-<name>`.
- **Review**: Code will be reviewed before merging.
